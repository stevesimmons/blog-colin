## Selective Data

The Age (13-12) says "Tunnel cost blows out to $6.7b".  "Blows out" is a
misnomer. The truth is the cost was not properly estimated.  The costs of large
projects are invariably understated.  Public sector projects are particularly
susceptible because politicians like to make premature annoucements for
political gain.  Private industry does not have a good record either. Overruns
of 70 per cent are common for large LNG projects. The main problem is bias in
the data selected and assumptions used.

I've spent over 40 years on major projects in the oil industry and my practical
experience supports academic commentators who attribute such bias to: (a)
project promoters deluding themselves about the difficulties that will be
experienced or seeking to manipulate the data for personal (or party) gain
and/or (b) plum bad luck.  However "blows out" is not the correct phrase to
use. The lessons of history need to be built into project estimates before
governments commit taxpayers' money.  A British Treasury guidenote says past
results demonstrate that at least 30 per cent should be added to the estimate
for any project to account for the inherent bias in the estimating process.
Clearly the tunnel estimate was not rigorous enough.
