## Heartfelt gesture

The PM and Bill Shorten have adopted the American faux solemn gesture of "hand
on heart" when laying wreaths etc. It's one thing to conform to US practice
when a guest in America but it is naff when done on home soil. A straight back,
solemn face and slight bow of the head is the Australian way. Let's stick with
that.
