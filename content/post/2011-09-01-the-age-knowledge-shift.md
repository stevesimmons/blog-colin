## Knowledge shift not smart for all

DISTORTION of the free market in support of manufacturing is unappealing but
should be considered in the interest of the bigger picture. Australia's
capitals are among the world's most liveable cities. One of the underlying
contributors must be the relative fairness of our society and traditionally
narrow spread of incomes (widening with the loss of manufacturing jobs).

Ross Gittins (Comment, 31-8) identifies the inevitable shift to knowledge and
service-based industries. A problem with a society based solely on these is
that there are not that many jobs at the well-paid end (e.g. Google and
Facebook are not big employers), and not everybody has the nature or the
nurture to fit into the knowledge-based world. In an economy led by
knowledge-based industries, the people who cannot benefit from training or
education will be consigned to low-paid jobs, with insufficient bargaining
power to escape from the minimum wage, or to the dole.

Let's not treat the loss of manufacturing as purely an economic problem. The
more diversified the economy, the greater the chance we have of maintaining a
civil, even, safe, fair society.
