## Disturbing dog-whistle from the Treasurer

What a disturbing dog-whistle from the previously decent-looking Joe Hockey -
that the co-payment is less than the cost of two beers or $22 a day spent on
cigarettes. A riff on the twin vices of the undeserving poor - beer and fags.
Well, get out there Joe; leave the comfortable confines of Canberra and talk to
some volunteers at the Salvos or St Vinnies, go into country Victoria or NSW
and have a look round. Many of us who had extreme good luck in our choice of
parents often have no idea of how little money a large part of the population
has left over once the bills are paid. Far from having the comforting macchiato
that you or I would have after visiting the doctor, a disturbing number of
people don't have the price of the bus fare home, let alone a beer. That's how
it is in today's partially employed, partially healthy Australia.
