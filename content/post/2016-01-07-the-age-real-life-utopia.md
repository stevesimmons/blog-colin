## Real-life 'Utopia'

The government is planning to spend $28 million on advertising its innovation
agenda (_The Age_, 6/1), on top of other outlays on promotional advertising.
This is the ABC TV program _Utopia_ made real. The government is putting a lot
of taxpayers' money into a marketing program but in reality doing nothing.

A culture of innovation cannot thrive without an active local manufacturing
industry and an educated workforce. It certainly won't happen if the government
limits its contribution to feel-good advertising and announcements.  Mr Pyne and
Mr Turnbull must take real steps to head off our drift into a torpid
post-industrial society. As a simple example, $150 million would probably have
kept the motor industry and its associated skills base here.  Australia will
remain in the third world of innovation unless the government tackles the
problems that require long-term commitment.
