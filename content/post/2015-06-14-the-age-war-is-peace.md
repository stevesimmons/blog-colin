## Federal Politics: War is peace, freedom is slavers, ignorance is ... 

When I read 1984 at school, many of the book's concepts seemed like science
fiction. But, race ahead to Australia today and nearly all of Big Brother's
slogans and practices are alive and well. "War is Peace" – a permanent state of
war to keep us compliant, justify the erosion of the rule of law and the
adoption of 24-hour-a-day surveillance of everybody. "Newspeak" – asylum
seekers always referred to as illegals, the words "global warming" not
permitted in government documents; and "Double think and blackwhite" – the
ability of ministers to recognise one set of facts in private but apparently
believe the ridiculous opposite in public, such as positions on climate change.
"Ignorance is Strength" summarises the government's thinking on science and
good free education generally. I'm not sure into which Orwellian category Mr
Dutton and Mr Abbott put Professor Gillian Triggs. Perhaps "Enemy of the State"
for being a bit too unfashionably honourable.
